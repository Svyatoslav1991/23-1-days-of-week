# 23-1-days-of-week

Using macros, implement a small program to enter the day of the week and output that day of the week as text to the console.
At the beginning of the program, the user enters the day of the week as its ordinal number. As a result, a letter display of this day of the week appears in the console.
In this exercise, you are not allowed to use classic variables except to store user input. You can't use string literals directly either. Everything should be implemented exclusively on macros.
